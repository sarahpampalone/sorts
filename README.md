/* The Bubblesort function uses a nested for loop, with one variable, a, starting at the beginning of the list, and another, b, starting at the end.
B will involve the numbers that will be checked and potentially switched, and a keeps track of place in the list.
If b is less than the number before it, the program switches the value. This repeats for the whole list. */

/* The Mergesort file contains two functions, merge and mergesort. 
The mergesort function recursively divides the list of data in half until it can be done no further.
These split lists continuously call the merge function, which reassembles these split lists until they are all in the correct order. */
